I made this a few years ago. I use it all the time, and I make abosolutely NO claim
about its reliability, usefulness, or stability. It works fine for me, but it would
be best if you operate under the assumption that for you it will run over your dog
and seduce your wife when you're not looking. I will not support it, and in fact
I've been thinking of rewriting it in a language I don't hate. This is a total
piece of crap, I know it, but it's useful for something.

It works under Linux. The parameters are set at the top of the file.
